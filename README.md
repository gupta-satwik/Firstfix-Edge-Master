# FixFirst Edge

[![CI](https://github.com/Ridwannurudeen/fixfirst-edge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Ridwannurudeen/fixfirst-edge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Demo:** [2-minute walkthrough on YouTube](https://youtu.be/eKGRRkdDurA) · **Live landing page:** [edge.gudman.xyz](https://edge.gudman.xyz)

**Offline multimodal maintenance copilot for industrial technicians.**

Search by photo of a broken part, error code, voice note, manual snippet, or past incident. Get back evidence-backed fix recommendations — the relevant manual section, the closest historical incident, and the likely replacement part. Everything runs **locally, with no internet**, on a laptop.

> **For the Actian VectorAI DB Build Challenge.** FixFirst Edge uses all three of the Actian features the rubric asks for: **named vectors** for multimodal retrieval (text + image + audio in one collection), **filtered search** with indexed keyword fields, and **hybrid RRF fusion** across a dense ANN lane and an Actian-native identifier-filtered ANN lane. It runs **100% offline** on a 16 GB laptop, CPU-only (the ~1 GB model footprint also fits an 8 GB machine; not yet measured at that floor), with no outbound network calls in the diagnose path. CI builds and runs the backend test suite on **x86_64 and ARM64 Linux** on every commit. End-to-end p50 **~850 ms**, p95 **~1100 ms** (see [Benchmark](#benchmark)).

## Why Actian VectorAI DB

FixFirst Edge is built on three Actian VectorAI DB features that are genuinely differentiating for this problem:

### 1. Named Vectors — true multimodal in one collection

One collection (`incidents`) holds three embedding spaces side-by-side:

| Vector | Model | Dim | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text_vec` | BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 | 384 | Manual chunks, incident text, error-code descriptions |
| `image_vec` | sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32 | 512 | Photos of damaged parts |
| `audio_text_vec` | bge-small-en-v1.5 over whisper transcripts | 384 | Voice notes |

No separate collections, no cross-store joins. A single document (e.g. an image-tagged incident) can carry both `text_vec` and `image_vec` and be retrievable through either modality. See [`backend/app/db.py`](backend/app/db.py) — `init_collection()` creates the three-vector schema, `upsert()` accepts any subset of the three.

### 2. Filtered Search — keyword-indexed metadata

Every query can be narrowed by `doc_type`, `machine_type`, `model_no`, `fault_code`, `severity`, or `part_no`. Filters are built with `FilterBuilder` against keyword-indexed fields. The `diagnose` endpoint uses this aggressively — e.g. it narrows part recommendations to only parts that fit the matched machine's model. See [`backend/app/db.py:_build_filter`](backend/app/db.py) and [`backend/app/services/search_service.py`](backend/app/services/search_service.py).

### 3. Hybrid Fusion (RRF) — dense + identifier-native in one query

Text search uses **reciprocal rank fusion** over:
- `text_vec` dense ANN (top-50)
- a second Actian-native retrieval lane that re-runs ANN with exact metadata filters extracted from the query (`fault_code`, `model_no`, `part_no`)

At ingest time, manuals, incidents, voice notes, and parts backfill those identifiers into indexed metadata fields. Merged with RRF (k=60), top-k returned. This matters for maintenance: the error code `E04` and identifiers like `CX-200` or `OL-E04-R` are promoted through exact Actian-side filters, while symptom phrases like "motor tripped on overload" are still captured by the dense branch. See [`backend/app/db.py:search_hybrid`](backend/app/db.py).

---

## How multimodal diagnose actually works

`/api/diagnose` always returns three evidence slots — the manual section, the similar incident, and the candidate part — regardless of which modality the user submitted. Getting there looks different depending on the input, and the design leans on Actian's **filter-indexed metadata as a shared case graph** rather than forcing a single embedding space to do everything:

- **Text query** → hybrid RRF directly. Dense ANN over `text_vec` plus the identifier-filtered ANN lane described above. Both branches run against the same collection, so a query like "E04 motor overload on CX-200" lands on the manual chunk, the incident, and the part in one fused pass.

- **Voice query** → transcribed locally by `faster-whisper` (tiny.en, CPU) into text, then run through the same hybrid path. In addition, `audio_text_vec` ANN is fused in so voice notes that were previously ingested (with their own transcripts embedded) surface even if the transcription wording differs.

- **Image query** → `image_vec` ANN over the CLIP space finds the nearest labeled schematic or image-tagged incident. The hit's indexed metadata — `model_no`, `fault_code`, `machine_type` — then becomes the seed for the text hybrid path, which fetches the corresponding manual section, incident, and part.

The image→text bridge is deliberate, not a fallback. Pure image-space diagnosis is a weak signal in maintenance: two schematics can look nearly identical but belong to different fault classes, and parts are identified by numbers, not pixels. What carries diagnostic signal is the **metadata that was filed with the image at ingest** (`model_no`, `fault_code`, technician notes). Actian's filtered search is what lets a one-shot image match become a structured entry point into the manual/incident/part graph. See [`backend/app/services/search_service.py:diagnose`](backend/app/services/search_service.py).

This is also why the hackathon's **filtered search** feature is central to the product, not decorative: it's the glue that turns three independent vector spaces into one cross-modal case graph.

---

## Why offline-only

Industrial sites have poor connectivity and strict data-egress rules. A plant tech's phone often has no signal near the machine. Cloud-backed "AI assistants" are also unauditable — a diagnostic answer generated by an LLM can't be traced back to a specific manual page or a specific prior incident.

FixFirst Edge responds with **templated evidence**, not LLM prose:

> Per conveyor_manual.pdf p.42: "Error E04 indicates thermal overload on the drive motor…"
>
> Previous incident on CX-200 resolved by: Replaced thermal overload relay and re-torqued motor mounts (downtime: 45 min)
>
> Likely replacement part: OL-E04-R (Thermal Overload Relay)

Every line traceable to a row in Actian. No hallucination surface.

### Stack

- **DB**: Actian VectorAI DB (Docker image `williamimoh/actian-vectorai-db:latest`)
- **Backend**: Python 3.11/3.12 + FastAPI + pdfplumber + sentence-transformers + faster-whisper
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Embeddings**: all local, CPU only, ~1.3 GB cached on first run

---

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Node 20+
- ~2 GB disk for model weights on first run

### 1. Start Actian

```bash
docker compose up -d actian
```

Or manually:

```bash
docker run -d --name vectoraidb -p 50051:50051 \
  --restart unless-stopped williamimoh/actian-vectorai-db:latest
```

**One-command full stack** (Actian + backend + frontend, for a judge or reviewer reproducing the app without HMR):

```bash
docker compose --profile full up --build
```

**Landing-page deployment** (static marketing site, for the public submission link):

- The canonical landing page is hosted at [edge.gudman.xyz](https://edge.gudman.xyz) on a VPS with Let's Encrypt.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-landing-pages.yml` publishes a mirror to `https://Ridwannurudeen.github.io/fixfirst-edge/` as a backup (no custom domain — DNS for `edge.gudman.xyz` stays on the VPS).
- The share/cover asset lives at `landing/cover.svg`.

### 2. Install backend

```bash
cd backend
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # or python3.12
pip install /path/to/actian_vectorai-0.1.0b2-py3-none-any.whl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12. `requirements.txt` pins `actian-vectorai==0.1.0b2`, but the SDK wheel must be installed from the Actian/organizer-provided beta package before running the requirements install. If the wheel is already installed, `pip install -r requirements.txt` treats the requirement as satisfied.

### 3. Seed data

Drop files into `data/raw/`:

- `manuals/*.pdf` — equipment manuals
- `images/*.{jpg,png}` — photos of damaged parts
- `voice/*.wav` — 16 kHz mono voice notes
- `incidents.csv` — columns: `id,machine_type,model_no,fault_code,severity,symptom,fix_applied,downtime_min,parts_used`
- `parts.csv` — columns: `part_no,name,machine_type,model_no`
- `error_codes.csv` — columns: `fault_code,machine_type,description`

Sample fixture CSVs are in [`data/fixtures/`](data/fixtures/). Copy them into `data/raw/` to try the pipeline, then replace with real data:

```bash
cp data/fixtures/*.csv data/raw/
```

To regenerate the full demo corpus (3 PDF service manuals, 6 schematic images, 5 voice notes) from the fixtures:

```bash
pip install reportlab pillow pyttsx3
python scripts/gen_demo_assets.py
```

Outputs land in `data/raw/manuals/`, `data/raw/images/`, `data/raw/voice/`. The generator is offline — no models or network needed.

### 4. Run backend + ingest

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 &
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/bulk_ingest.py
```

### 5. Run frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

The frontend targets `http://localhost:8000` by default for local development. For split deployments, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` explicitly. The backend allows local browser requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default. Override with `CORS_ORIGINS` if you need a different frontend origin.

### 6. Verify offline

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/verify_offline.py
```

The verifier exercises `/api/health` plus the real `/api/diagnose` flow for text, image, and voice. If image or voice fixtures are missing under `data/raw/`, those checks print `SKIP` instead of pretending the system was verified. Disconnect WiFi after ingest — the app keeps working. The status banner now has three honest states: **OFFLINE — Ready locally** when Actian is reachable and the `incidents` collection is initialized, **OFFLINE — Local DB not initialized** when the backend is up but the collection is missing, and **OFFLINE — Local API unavailable** when the frontend cannot reach the backend at all.

---

## API

The Next.js UI is built around a single unified entry point — `POST /api/diagnose` — that fuses text, image, and voice in one request and returns evidence + templated recommendation. The `/api/search/*` endpoints are the lower-level developer API surface, exposing each modality and filter independently for programmatic use.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | `{status, online, db, collection_ready}` |
| POST | `/api/ingest/manual` | multipart: PDF + machine_type + model_no |
| POST | `/api/ingest/incident` | JSON row → auto-detects incident vs. error_code |
| POST | `/api/ingest/image` | multipart: image + machine_type + optional model_no/fault_code/severity/part_no |
| POST | `/api/ingest/voice` | multipart: WAV + machine_type |
| POST | `/api/ingest/part` | JSON row |
| POST | `/api/search/text` | JSON: `{query, filters?}` → RRF hybrid (dense ANN + identifier-filtered ANN) |
| POST | `/api/search/image` | multipart: image + filters → `image_vec` ANN |
| POST | `/api/search/voice` | multipart: WAV + filters → `audio_text_vec` ANN fused with transcript hybrid |
| POST | `/api/search/multimodal` | multipart: text + image + audio + filters → RRF across modalities |
| POST | `/api/diagnose` | multipart: query + image + voice + filters → **primary UI entry point**, templated evidence answer |
| POST | `/api/incident/save` | JSON verified incident row → live-indexed |

---

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests -q
# 21 passed
```

All pipelines unit-tested with fake embedders / mock search results (no network, no models needed for CI).

## Benchmark

End-to-end `/api/diagnose` latency, warmed, over 20 mixed queries (error codes, part numbers, symptom phrases, machine IDs) against the full demo corpus — **3 PDF service manuals, 30 incidents, 25 parts, 13 error codes, 6 schematic images, 5 voice notes**. Runs on a 16 GB laptop, CPU-only, WSL2 + Docker, all models local:

| metric | ms |
|---|---|
| p50 | **843** |
| p95 | **1093** |
| mean | 900 |
| min | 781 |
| max | 1094 |

Numbers are stable across three consecutive runs (tightest cluster: p50 843–859 ms, p95 1081–1120 ms) on a fresh Actian collection after `bulk_ingest`. Each request embeds the query, runs hybrid RRF (dense + identifier-filtered ANN), then runs three more filter-scoped retrievals for the manual/incident/part slots — nine total vector operations per user query. Headroom exists: larger corpus + GPU embedding would trade differently.

20/20 queries returned a full evidence set (manual section + similar incident + candidate part). Every request exercises: query-text embedding → hybrid RRF (dense ANN + identifier-filtered ANN) → three additional per-slot retrievals for manual/incident/part. Reproduce with `python backend/scripts/bench_diagnose.py`.

## Submission Readiness

Before final DoraHacks submission, run:

```bash
python scripts/check_submission_readiness.py
```

It fails if the repo still contains placeholder demo/team/cover fields or if the landing page is still using the fallback demo block instead of a real embed.
