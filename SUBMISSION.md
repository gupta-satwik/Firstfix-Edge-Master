## Project name

FixFirst Edge

## Tagline (≤120 chars)

Offline multimodal maintenance copilot — search manuals, incidents, photos, and voice notes locally with Actian VectorAI DB.

## One-line description

An offline copilot that helps industrial technicians fix machines fast by retrieving evidence from manuals, prior incidents, parts catalogs, photos, and voice notes — all on a laptop, no internet required.

## Category / Track

Actian VectorAI DB Build Challenge — main track.

## Judging highlights

Seven things that separate this entry from a typical hackathon submission. All verifiable from the repo and the live site.

1. **All three rubric features used in load-bearing ways.** Named vectors carry text, image, and audio embeddings side-by-side in one collection. Filtered search hits Actian's keyword index in-engine on six metadata fields. Hybrid RRF fuses a dense ANN lane with an identifier-filtered ANN lane — not theatre, the diagnose endpoint actually exercises both.
2. **Reproducible benchmarks, not marketing numbers.** End-to-end `/api/diagnose` p50 = 843ms, p95 = 1093ms, warmed, 16 GB laptop, CPU-only. Reproduce with `scripts/bench_diagnose.py`. Most submissions claim "fast" without receipts.
3. **Full multimodal pipeline.** bge-small (text, 384d), CLIP-ViT-B-32 (image, 512d), faster-whisper tiny.en (audio → text, 384d) — all embedded locally on CPU. Most entries will be text-only.
4. **Real-world positioning.** Offline industrial maintenance is a $50B downtime problem, not another LLM-wrapper. The category is wide open — no incumbent owns the offline / air-gapped wedge we address.
5. **Production-grade landing page at [edge.gudman.xyz](https://edge.gudman.xyz).** Benchmarked directly against Augury, MaintainX, UpKeep, Fiix, Limble, Dozuki, Tulip, and Aquant. Includes an in-browser interactive retrieval widget against the real demo corpus.
6. **Production sensibility.** 21 backend tests passing, MIT-licensed, public repo, deployed domain, one-command `./start.sh` + `./stop.sh` lifecycle, `docker compose` full-stack deployment, regenerable demo corpus (3 PDFs, 6 schematics, 5 voice notes, 30 incidents, 25 parts, 13 error codes). Continuous integration runs the suite on **x86_64 and ARM64 Linux** on every commit (GitHub Actions, free public-repo runners) — portability is verified, not asserted.
7. **Interactive demo on the landing page.** Visitors can type a query and see real browser-measured retrieval latency against the demo corpus — no install required to verify the core claim.

## Full description

Industrial downtime costs an estimated $50B per year. When a machine faults, the technician on the floor has minutes, not hours, to diagnose the problem. The information needed — equipment manuals, historical incidents, parts catalogs, even colleagues' voice notes — exists, but it is scattered across PDFs, spreadsheets, and shared drives, and the plant floor rarely has reliable internet.

FixFirst Edge is an offline multimodal maintenance copilot that fits on a 16 GB laptop (model footprint also fits 8 GB; not yet measured at that floor). A technician can search by error code, symptom text, a photo of the damaged part, or a spoken voice note. The system retrieves the most relevant evidence across all of these modalities in a single query and returns a templated, fully traceable fix recommendation — the relevant manual section, the closest prior incident, and the likely replacement part.

Every answer is auditable. No LLM is used in the diagnostic response; all recommendations are templated from retrieved rows in the vector store, each traceable back to a specific page of a specific manual or a specific prior incident.

## Why Actian VectorAI DB

Three Actian features make this workload possible in a single database, not a stitched-together pipeline:

1. **Named Vectors** — one `incidents` collection carries three embedding spaces side-by-side: `text_vec` (384d, bge-small-en-v1.5) for manual text, `image_vec` (512d, CLIP-ViT-B-32) for photos, and `audio_text_vec` (384d, bge-small over whisper transcripts) for voice notes. A single document can carry any subset of the three, and any modality can retrieve across the others.

2. **Filtered Search** — every query can be narrowed by `doc_type`, `machine_type`, `model_no`, `fault_code`, `severity`, or `part_no`. Filters hit Actian's keyword-indexed metadata, not post-filtered in Python. The diagnose endpoint uses this aggressively — it narrows part recommendations to only parts that fit the matched machine's model.

3. **Hybrid Fusion (RRF)** — text queries run a reciprocal rank fusion over dense ANN (top-50 on `text_vec`) and a second Actian-native retrieval lane that re-runs ANN with exact identifier filters extracted from the query (`fault_code`, `model_no`, `part_no`). During ingest, those identifiers are backfilled into indexed metadata fields for manuals, incidents, parts, and voice notes. This matters: tokens like `E04`, `CX-200`, and `OL-E04-R` are promoted through indexed metadata filters, while symptom phrases like "motor tripped on overload" are still dense-retrievable. RRF covers both.

## Why offline-only

Industrial sites have poor connectivity, strict data-egress rules, and technicians whose phones often have no signal near the machine. Cloud-backed AI assistants are also unauditable — an LLM-generated diagnostic can't be traced to a specific manual page. FixFirst Edge is 100% local. All embedding models (bge-small, CLIP, whisper tiny.en) run on CPU with no outbound requests. A green "OFFLINE — Running locally" banner on the UI is the demo's centerpiece.

## Tech stack

- **Database**: Actian VectorAI DB (Docker image `williamimoh/actian-vectorai-db:latest`, gRPC :50051)
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ · FastAPI · pdfplumber · sentence-transformers · faster-whisper · pydantic
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · lucide-react
- **Embeddings**: all local, CPU, ~1.3 GB of cached weights on first run
- **Infra**: Docker Compose — Actian + backend container; frontend runs outside Docker for HMR

## What we built during the hackathon

- Full FastAPI backend with 12 endpoints across ingest / search / diagnose
- Three-vector Actian collection with `init_collection`, `upsert`, `search_text`, `search_image`, `search_audio`, `search_hybrid` (RRF), `health`
- Multimodal pipelines: text (bge-small), image (CLIP), audio (whisper tiny.en), PDF chunker, CSV loader
- Diagnose service that chains three filtered retrievals (manual → incident → part) and builds a templated, evidence-backed answer
- Next.js 14 frontend with UploadZone, SearchBar, FilterPanel, DiagnosePanel, OfflineBanner
- `verify_offline.py` — cold end-to-end smoke test
- Fixture CSV + demo asset generator (3 PDF manuals, 6 schematic images, 5 voice notes — fully regenerable from fixtures)
- 21 backend tests, all green
- Benchmark script (`scripts/bench_diagnose.py`) producing the reproducible p50 / p95 numbers cited above
- `start.sh` / `stop.sh` — single-command local lifecycle
- Production landing page deployed to [edge.gudman.xyz](https://edge.gudman.xyz) with a real browser-native retrieval widget against the demo corpus

## How to run

**One command from the repo root:**

```bash
./start.sh
```

Boots the Actian DB container, the FastAPI backend, ingests the demo corpus on first run, launches the Next.js frontend, and opens the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Stop with `./stop.sh`.

Manual five-step path is documented in the README and the `#install` section of [edge.gudman.xyz](https://edge.gudman.xyz/#install).

Once the UI is open, disconnect your WiFi — the app keeps working.
